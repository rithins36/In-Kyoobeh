# In-Kyoobeh



A useful tool that allows you to know who is currently at your hostel. 
Anyone who wishes to know the whereabouts of the people must themselves surrender their whereabouts.
Since the app only shows the number/list of people in the hostel, privacy issues are reduced.

The app acts as an open source alternative to Snap Maps, Find my Friends etc.

The application of the app can be further extended to take attendance in a classroom.
Attendance taking is usually a cumbersome process, 
this app smoothens the ancient roll call method of attendance taking by creating an automated and innovative opensource technique.
